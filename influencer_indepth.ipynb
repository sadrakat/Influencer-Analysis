Not bad considering I started running properly 8 weeks ago. Just another thing I wanted to point out because to me on a personal note it's huge and I'm proud of myself. It's the first time I've made the journey and run on my own. That's not the big part, I had to email ahead to let the organizers know about my disability and that I couldn't pin my race number onto my top because of my dystonia in both hands. The organizers were incredible and helped me when I needed help. The moral of the story is don't let your situation stop you from doing whatever you want to do.

It's unfortunate how some individuals with hidden disabilities are misunderstood and face stigma. It's also heartbreaking to hear about cases where parents are wrongly accused of Munchausen by proxy and how it can have a lasting impact on families. It's clear that there needs to be more support and understanding for individuals with disabilities, both hidden and visible, in terms of financial assistance and access to necessary services. The government should take action to improve the benefits system and ensure that everyone can live a dignified life without having to rely on food banks.
